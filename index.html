        <h3>designer | artist | writer | programmer</h3>
        <h4>So often do I hear that art and computer science do not go hand in hand.
            You are either "an artist" or "a programmer," never both. I recently went to a
            SCAD show where Epic Games came to talk about Unreal 4, and the dichotomy between
            art and coding was the core focus of their presentation: UE4 has invented a way to
            generate code without knowing any C++ via their (admittedly clever) Blueprints system.
            As ingenious as that is, it drove home the point that there aren't people who bridge
            those two realms. I'm here to try and prove that you can do both, and that you can be
            successful doing it. My strong points are my creativity, ability to communicate, and eye for
            design, yes, but also my ability to solve problems and desire to have a deep understanding
            of the things I do. And I find that having skills both in the fine arts and in the computer
            science field has given me a unique perspective on the subjects; in a lot of ways,
            coding is every bit as much of an art form as poetry, I think, in how you can start from scratch and create
            something entirely new that has the possibility of changing and affecting the outside world. It's a medium
            for communication, and I ultimately want to create programs and games that use technology as an art, to
            affect how people think and feel and to challenge the status quo.</h4>

            <h4>I'm not there yet, but I'm on my way, and I already have a lot to show for the work I've done.
            This page in and of itself is a great example. Everything on this page was created by me: the
            graphics, the layout, the HTML and CSS code, the text, the social media icons at the bottom of the page, everything.
            And this is a portable website; it scales to smaller screens in a sleek and easy way. If you're interested,
            you can see more of my work by checking out the links above, where you'll find some of my art, my creative writing blog,
            a page discussing my video game projects and experience, and my resume. If you have any questions or are interested in
            anything I'm working on, I encourage you to find me on LinkedIn or Facebook.
